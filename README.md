# TSE-NBSVM
Project by Nicolas Le Gall and Paul Barriere.
The objective is to implement the NBSVM method introduced in *Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification* written by Sida Wang and Christopher D. Manning.

We have defined functions to implement this methods. These functions are stored in the Functions_NBSVM.py file. We used a dataset containing reviews of 5 products coming from amazon.com. This dataset is here to illustrate our work and is explained with more details in Readme_data.txt (the data is stored in the Data folder).

The file report.ipynb is a notebook showing our implementation of this method. It is supposed to be run in google colab and using (!git clone) command you download all the files directly on your colab. The step by step method is explained in the report where we detail the implementation.
